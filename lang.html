      <h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
      <p>
        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are
        two fundamental technologies used to create and style websites. They
        work hand in hand to define the structure and appearance of web pages.
        <br /><br />
        HTML is a markup language used for creating the basic structure and
        content of web pages. It consists of a series of elements or tags
        enclosed in angle brackets. These tags define the different parts of a
        web page such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, forms, and
        more. HTML elements are structured to create a hierarchical
        representation of the web page's content.
        <br /><br />
        For example, the following HTML code represents a simple web page
        structure with a heading, paragraph, and an image:
        <br /><br />
        ```<br />
        &#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;<br />
        &#8195;&#60;html&#62;<br />
        &#8195;&#8195;&#60;head&#62;<br />
        &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; &#60;title&#62;My First Web
        Page&#60;/title&#62;<br />
        &#8195;&#8195; &#60;/head&#62;<br />
        &#8195;&#8195; &#60;body&#62;<br />
        &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; &#60;h1&#62;Welcome to My Website!&#60;/h1&#62;<br />
        &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#60;p&#62;This is a sample
        paragraph.&#60;/p&#62;<br />
        &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; &#60;img src="image.jpg" alt="Sample
        Image"&#62;<br />
        &#8195;&#8195; &#60;/body&#62;<br />
        &#8195;&#60;/html&#62;<br />
        ```<br /><br />

        CSS, on the other hand, is a style sheet language used to describe the
        presentation or visual appearance of a web document written in HTML. It
        defines how the HTML elements should be displayed, including attributes
        like color, font, layout, and more. CSS allows you to separate the
        structure from the presentation, making it easier to manage the look and
        feel of a website.
        <br /><br />
        CSS selectors select HTML elements based on their tags, classes, IDs,
        attributes, and other properties. Using these selectors, you can apply
        styles to specific elements individually or even across entire groups of
        elements.
        <br /><br />
        Heres an example of CSS code that changes the color and font of the
        heading and paragraph from the previous HTML example:
        <br /><br />
        ```css<br />
        h1 {<br />
        &#8195;color: blue;<br />
        &#8195;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;<br />
        }<br />
        <br />
        p {<br />
        &#8195;color: green;<br />
        &#8195;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;<br />
        }<br />
        ```
        <br /><br />
        By linking the CSS file to the HTML document using the `&#60;link&#62;`
        tag or by defining CSS styles directly within the HTML file using the
        `&#60;style&#62;` tag, the styles will be applied to the respective HTML
        elements.
        <br /><br />
        HTML and CSS both have extensive specifications and features beyond the
        basics mentioned here. They form the foundation of web design and
        development and are essential skills for creating visually appealing and
        structurally sound websites.

      <h3>SQL</h3>
      <p>
        SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language
        specifically designed for managing and manipulating relational
        databases. It was developed in the 1970s and has since become a crucial
        tool for working with data in a wide range of applications.
        <br /><br />
        Here are some key aspects and features of SQL:
        <br /><br />
        1. Relational database management: SQL is used to interact with
        relational database management systems (RDBMS). RDBMS store data in
        tables with relationships defined between them, allowing for efficient
        and structured data management.
        <br /><br />
        2. Data querying and manipulation: SQL provides a set of commands that
        allow users to query the database and retrieve specific data based on
        conditions, filter results, and perform calculations. It enables data
        manipulation operations such as inserting, updating, and deleting
        records.
        <br /><br />
        3. Data definition: SQL's Data Definition Language (DDL) allows the
        definition, modification, and organization of database objects like
        tables, views, indexes, and constraints. DDL statements are used to
        create, alter, and drop database structures.
        <br /><br />
        4. Data manipulation: SQL's Data Manipulation Language (DML) provides
        statements for manipulating data within the database. INSERT, UPDATE,
        and DELETE statements are used to modify existing records or add new
        ones.
        <br /><br />
        5. Data retrieval: SQL's SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from
        tables based on specified conditions. The SELECT statement supports
        various clauses such as WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY, allowing
        for complex and customized data retrieval.
        <br /><br />
        6. Data integrity and constraints: SQL supports the definition of
        constraints to enforce data integrity rules within the database.
        Constraints can ensure data validity, uniqueness, referential integrity,
        and other rules that maintain the integrity of the data.
        <br /><br />
        7. Joins and relationships: SQL allows for joining tables based on
        common columns or relationships defined between them. Joins enable
        combining data from multiple tables, making it possible to retrieve
        related data for analysis and reporting.
        <br /><br />
        8. Transactions: SQL supports transactions that help maintain the
        consistency and integrity of data within the database. Transactions
        allow for executing multiple database operations as a single logical
        unit, ensuring that all changes are either committed or rolled back in
        case of failures.
        <br /><br />
        9. SQL standards: SQL is based on standardized syntax defined by the
        American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International
        Organization for Standardization (ISO). Although many variations and
        dialects of SQL exist, most comply with ANSI/ISO standards to ensure
        portability and interoperability across different database systems.
        <br /><br />
        10. Widely-used database language: SQL is widely adopted and supported
        by virtually all major relational database systems, including Oracle,
        MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, and others. It is a
        fundamental skill for anyone working with data and databases, from
        developers and data analysts to database administrators.
        <br /><br />
        SQL's simplicity, reliability, and widespread adoption have made it a
        fundamental language for managing and manipulating databases. With SQL,
        users can define database structures, query and retrieve data, modify
        data, and ensure data integrity. Its intuitive syntax and broad support
        across various database systems make it a powerful tool for working with
        structured data.
