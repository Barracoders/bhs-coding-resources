# BHS-Coding-Resources
This was an older website made by Joshua Worthington about some resources you could use in Barracoders, it was orginally used to show off at club fair and club meetings. It is unfinished but still has some good resources and a stable version is up and running at <a href="https://bhs-coding-resources.glitch.me">bhs-coding-resources.glitch.me</a>

### It has since been completly redesigned and moved to <a href="https://barracoders.com/resources">Our Websites Resources Page</a>
